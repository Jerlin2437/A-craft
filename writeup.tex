\section{Introduction}
To preface, we have decided to use DFS as our main method to generate our maze. We have used the repository, https://github.com/algoprog/Laby, to base our own implementation of the maze generation in our project. We mainly used Chris's implementation since it also included a start and end node within the 2d 101x101 maze matrix.

\section{Question 1}
Here, we will explore a bit about the A star algorithm.
